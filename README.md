## Project Title: Terraforming Infrastructure: A Journey from Shell Script to Terraform

### Description:
In this project, I embarked on a journey to deploy a web application on AWS infrastructure, starting with shell scripting and transitioning to Terraform for infrastructure management. The project aimed to explore the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches while highlighting the evolution towards modern infrastructure as code practices.


#### Advantages and Disadvantages:

##### Shell Script:

Advantages: Shell scripting provides a simple and familiar environment for automating tasks and deploying infrastructure. It's quick to prototype and accessible for those experienced with Unix-like systems.
Disadvantages: Despite its simplicity, shell scripts lack the abstraction and scalability required for managing complex infrastructure. They are prone to errors and execute sequentially, leading to longer deployment times compared to Terraform.

##### Terraform:

Advantages: Terraform offers infrastructure as code capabilities, promoting versioning, collaboration, and repeatability. Its declarative syntax abstracts complexities, while parallel execution significantly reduces deployment times, sometimes by up to 10x compared to shell scripts.
Disadvantages: While Terraform provides powerful features, there's a learning curve involved, particularly for newcomers to infrastructure as code. Managing Terraform state files and dealing with provider limitations can pose challenges in certain scenarios.


### In conclusion:
Transitioning from shell scripting to Terraform was primarily driven by the need for faster deployment times. While shell scripting offered simplicity and familiarity, its sequential execution model led to longer deployment times as compared to Terraform's parallel execution capabilities. Terraform's ability to execute tasks concurrently resulted in significant time savings, making it a more efficient choice for managing infrastructure deployments, especially at scale.
